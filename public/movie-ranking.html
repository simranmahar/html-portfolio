<p>This is my favourite movie.This is a comedy movie with strong acting ,memorable <br />characters, a perlexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie <br /> to choose the right path in your life. </p>

<h3>King Kong</h3>
</li>

<p>This is my another favourite movie.It was beauty killing the beast.Its passionate,<br /> mournful, subtle, satisfying, intense, and an impressive achievement in every field <br />overall, end of story.</p>
<li>
<h3>Ghajini</h3></li>
<img src="../Images/ghajini.jpg" width="500" height="470" />
<p>This is my another favourite movie.Ghajini is a thoroughbred Bollywood film <br />which celebrates the formula with panache.It has loads of action,comedy,drama <br />and romance which makes it a family packed entertainer.</p>
<li>
<h3>Warm bodies</h3></li>
<img src="../Images/Warm-Bodies.jpeg" width="500" height="470" />
<p>This is my another favourite movie."Warm Bodies" is a well-paced, nicely <br />directed, post-apocalyptic love story with a terrific sense of humor and the, <br />um, guts to be unabashedly romantic and unapologetically optimistic.</p>
<li>
<h3>Hanuman</h3></li>
<img src="../Images/Hanuman.jpg" width="500" height="470" />
<p>This is my another favourite movie. The animated film dramatizes the life of its <br />title character, Hanuman, a Hindu Deity.This animated movie depicts Hanuman's<br /> life from birth.</p>
