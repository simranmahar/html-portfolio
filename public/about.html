  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings everyone,</p>
<p>
  I'm Simran Mahar, a fervent explorer in the realms of web development and problem-<br />
  solving. Currently in my third year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,<br />
  I'm deeply engrossed in unraveling the intricacies of technology and its applications.<br />
  My journey thus far has been illuminated by the challenges I've encountered and the so<br />
  -lutions I've crafted along the way.</p>
<p>
  Beyond the confines of code, I find solace and inspiration in the rhythms of singing,<br />
  the fluidity of dance, the adventures of travel, and the creativity of art and craft.<br /> 
  These passions fuel my spirit and provide a much-needed balance to my technical pursuits.</p>
<p>
  In my philosophy, I firmly embrace the ethos of focusing on consistency over fixating <br />
  on immediate results. I believe that true growth and mastery emerge from a steadfast <br />
  commitment to improvement, regardless of the outcomes that may follow.</p>
<p>
  I look forward to sharing insights, learning from each other, and embarking on this<br />
  journey of discovery together.
</p>
